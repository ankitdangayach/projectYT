 Part C - Provide a document describing

o   Which design patterns have you used in the implementation
I have simply used spring boot framework, with that I have provided Swagger implementation.

o   Schema describing the messages produced by the solution
This application will genrate a solution based on below DTO's:

   1.  private String url;
   2.  private String videoTitle;

o   How to compile the source code produced
Just do mvn clean install and project will be compiled, I have removed my API Key from the code, for testing purpose please use your own API key so that it can give you the proper results.

o   How to execute your programs to produce the results previously described
Just hit the swagger endpoint and provide two things and it will show you the logs.

o   Looking back at the implementation, what would you consider doing differently.
1. I am not sure whether i can directly hit the YouTube api through rest template, i have tried that but have not got succeed,
2. integration test are missing because of the time limitation.
